# Krolla

## Description

**Krolla** is tool that uses [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to inform users about *Mixed Content* usage on their brand-new `http://` websites.

## TODO

- [ ] Adding crawling ability
- [ ] Use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) further to indicate where the *Mixed Content* is located on the page
- [ ] `failedRequests` and `mixedContentIssues` should be wrapped in a common class exposing `get`/`set`
